# fftw2.15
Old fftw code used to build GrIMP C code

This repository contains a very old version of fftw2.15. The configure process will not work on some systems (e.g., MacOS). As a result, the binaries for the individual routines needed to build the GrIMP code can be built with the script that accompanies the tar file. In many cases, the code has been compiled with the .o files, fftw/$(MACHTYPE)-$OS directories.
